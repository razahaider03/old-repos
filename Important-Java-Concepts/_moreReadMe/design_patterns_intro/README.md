# Introduction to Design Patterns

In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

## Uses of Design Patterns :
Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms. Effective software design requires considering issues that may not become visible until later in the implementation. Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems and improves code readability for coders and architects familiar with the patterns.

Design patterns provide general solutions which are easy to apply to a broader range of problems, documented in a format that doesn't require specifics tied to a particular problem. In addition, patterns allow developers to communicate using well-known, well understood names for software interactions. Common design patterns can be improved over time, making them more robust than ad-hoc designs.

## 1 Creational Design Patterns
Creational design patterns are concerned with the way of creating objects. These design patterns are used when a decision must be made at the time of instantiation of a class (i.e. creating an object of a class). But everyone knows an object is created by using new keyword in java. 
Hard-Coded code is not the good programming approach. Here, we are creating the instance by using the new keyword. Sometimes, the nature of the object must be changed according to the nature of the program. In such cases, we must get the help of creational design patterns to provide more general and flexible approach.

- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Singleton
- Prototype
- Builder
- Object Pool


## 2 Structural Design Patterns
Structural design patterns are concerned with how classes and objects can be composed, to form larger structures.
The structural design patterns simplifies the structure by identifying the relationships.
These patterns focus on, how the classes inherit from each other and how they are composed from other classes.

- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

## 3 Behavioral Design Patterns
Behavioral design patterns are concerned with the interaction and responsibility of objects.
In these design patterns,the interaction between the objects should be in such a way that they can easily talk to each other and still should be loosely coupled.
That means the implementation and the client should be loosely coupled in order to avoid hard coding and dependencies.
